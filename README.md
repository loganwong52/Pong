# Pong

In the terminal, type python3 main.py.

A start screen appears. Press enter to play.
Use the up and down arrow keys to control the white paddle on the left.

Use the space bar to shoot the yellow ball to the right.
Note that the ball will shoot straight, and not keep its initial momentum from
you moving up/down.

The opponent in red on the right will move up and down to try to block the ball and
bounce it back to you.

You will lose if the yellow ball goes past you (out of bounds) on the left.
You will win if the yellow ball goes past the opponent on the right.

If you lose or win, you will be shown the game over page.
This page shows your score and the opponent's score.

Press the enter key to continue playing.
Scores are kept from previous games, but not previous sessions.
